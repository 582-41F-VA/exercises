# Exercise: Events

For this assignment, your task is to implement a `RadioSet` component
that renders a `<fieldset>` with [radio inputs]. It must accept the
following props:

- the `name` of the inputs,
- a list of `options`, each with a value and label; and
- an `onChange` function that the component calls with the selected
  value when users click on an input.
